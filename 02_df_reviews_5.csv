We've seen too many folks make a killer lease deal, only to hate the car they chose.We answer 200-300 lease questions each day, and we moderators have to use our time wisely to answer the questions that come in.I have a very flexible budget, but I want to prioritize the value I'll be getting from a lease rather than the absolute number I'll be paying, which is why I've been cross shopping so many different types of cars. I have a lease that is ending in 3 weeks, so I am trying to gather the data on all the vehicles I am interested in and crunch all the numbers beforehand before I go to any dealers because dealership visits are one of the things in life that I most despise doing. I work a 9 to 5 in an office so I have some time throughout the day while I am sitting at my desk to crunch the numbers and decide what my target numbers are for a specific car. I am a long time Honda buyer which is why I have asked for requests for an Accord, Passport, Pilot, TLX, and MDX, but I also saw from research that the Jeep GC has solid lease numbers, so I decided to add that to my short list of vehicles also.

As for all the Honda cars I have inquired about, I have driven so many Hondas over the past 10 years and loved all of them so much that I know I will be completely satisfied with whichever Honda product I pick. Part of the reason I've had so many is that leasing them is really cost efficient as well. ",No

I know it really depends on how to negotiate with them, but do you think $30K OTD will be reasonable?I don't see how you can get another $3000+ off the OTD prices you've been given.Showing up in person does signify your seriousness to complete a transaction, but if you don't get to a place where both you and the dealer will be happy, it's best to just walk away.Hi Michaell,I'm not sure if I'm calculate correctly, if not please advice!After fees and tax, it came out OTD $33158.02Should I subtract the vin etch/accessories(which I dont need) and than negotiate the Doc fee? Also I've been search that we should not pay for destination fee as well so I will cross off that. I also own honda vehicle which one of dealer said it can be use for loyalty program $500 off.What I found from other person buying a car,people can negotiate get $3000 off of MSRP, so I thought that is reasonable since they have so much markup.I did check KBB or edmunds, does the price on there include fees and tax?I'd negotiate the price to offset the VIN Etch fee.The destination fee is part of the MSRP; you won't be able to eliminate it.Most pricing sites do not includes fees and taxes, since they are so regional.

Am I wrong? If I am wrong, could you provide the residual for both 30k/36k?3- This may be a little more complex/extended question. I am just trying to understand the math below is the correct one to determine the lease payment calculated by the dealers. - There are 7 components to determine the monthly pay: MSRP, residual, term, sales price, capitalized amount, financed amount, and MF.- The MSRP (non-negotiable) is used to determine the residual amount.- The capitalized amount derives from the sale price of the car (which is negotiable) plus any fees (dealer/DMV/acquisition) less any upfront payments (rebates, 1st payment, downpayment).- Then the monthly payment is calculated by adding the cap and residual amounts (financed amount) and dividing them by the term of the lease.- The interest part of the payment uses the financed amount multiplied by the MF. The interest plus the amount from the previous step will get to the monthly payment (before taxes). Thanks in advance. ",No
