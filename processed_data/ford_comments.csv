I believe even Chris Harris said ""Ford is just trying to give you a lot for your money"" and I think compared to other cars the ST2s and ST3s are shocking values. The ST1 has NO comp at the price unless you are looking at used Speed3s or Fiesta's. My last point is this constant complaining from reviewers about the turning radius and the fact that you have to pull the headrest to lower seats (pull seat bottoms as well); I live in an urban area, lots of tight turns and changing direction; if the radius is the trade off for better steering then who cares? Seriously what's the difference between a 2point and 3point turn? As for the seats; have you sat in the rear of a Fit or a Mazda3? Thin is the best you can say about those seats. The Focus is a five door that most people use for passengers, would it be better to a quick-fold seat?

Mine is a 2016, not sure if that'd make any difference efficiency wise, but I doubt it should.

I have an FSWerks 93 Oct tune and averaged 25mpg mixed driving on my last tank (city and freeway) and going wide open throttle at least 6-12 times over the tank, but generally just commuting. I've also tried with the stock tune and got similar results, about 25.5mph mixed.

The lowest averages I've gotten have been 22-23mpg. I think recently, gas may have switched from winter/cold weather formula to summer/warm weather, so probably getting a little more efficiency now. Babying it and driving like a sane person, I think you could eek ~27mpg out of it mixed driving, but driving like that kinda defeats the point of a car like this.",NEGATIVE,0.997355580329895,j2jVXKGvz9A,219,2017-04-21 22:47:29+00:00

In normal/sport it feels rather similar to what I had in the FRS.  I daily drive my RS and have put close to 10,000km so far and it's been nothing short of impressive with hundreds of smiles along the way. The RS is purpose built, and quite honestly it was designed for the ultimate enthusiast, someone who is a fan of the RS brand/heritage and those looking for a balls to the wall hatchback with no compromises. Unfortunately I find those who complain about the ride in the RS tend to be those who have never owned a proper sports car/performance vehicle. The ride may be harsh but definitely not punishing. My wife who is currently 6 months pregnant hasn't complained once, and my 2 year old son laughs and giggles at the pops and burbles. The Focus RS is an experience, it's a purpose built hot hatch that brings the smiles in many ways. The more I drive my beast, the more I fall in love. Kudos to Ford for having the balls to build cars like the RS/ST, in a time when MPG is at the forefront of the industry.",POSITIVE,0.9978508949279785,j2jVXKGvz9A,219,2017-04-21 22:47:29+00:00

Short story here, up until recently I was moving cars for a local used car dealer between cities. I did little reviews for my friends, it was fun. Driving a bunch of different vehicles I looked at them in different ways. Most cars are generally just.. pretty good. They're new, they work, whatever. One day I was tasked with moving an escape to a dealer about 3 hours away. I like the kinda wacky Ford interior despite the fucking stupid numpad that's just.. Why!? But holy shit. This was a '14 or '15 Escape S. Base model, FWD. I Have never driven a more of a pile from a modern vehicle. Gutless, terrible mileage, not really that comfortable.Yeah I guess you can cram some shit in there but fuck, what a heartless car. I ended up out of sheer boredom driving it at like 3/4 throttle the whole way doing a MASSIVE 80mph out of the gutless 2.5L - also 2.5L, it should have some power/torque, but nah, it's shit. Computer listed 18mpg, burnt 7/8 tank in 3 hours, fuck. Yeah it could be better if you drove slower, but you should EXPECT better from a DECENT and MODERN vehicle which this car misses the take on. Anyways, I haven't driven it but i image the 1.5 ecoboost with *less power* but a tiny bit more torque would be just as much a fucking taint-heap. It's just, infuriatingly, and wholly unimpressive for what it should be.

There's a tiny bit of turbo lag, but throttle response is still much faster than the old truck. You might feel a little deadness with the EB, but after a very minimal delay the engine takes off much much quicker.

Also, part of the reason for the inclusion of the offroad modes is that throttle response, shift points, and traction control are also all adjusted with each mode. Sport and Baja modes, for example, keep the turbos spooled and engine RPM around 3k so you have power constantly on demand, and Baja in particular lets you really fling the truck around without the nannies interfering.",POSITIVE,0.9106202125549316,ocF6IsOk-pg,234,2017-08-04 14:30:31+00:00

I so hate when auto journalists see an engine used in a sports car and call it ""de-tuned"" when it's put into a larger application. The engines power band has been mapped to deal with a vehicle that weighs another 1500-2000 pounds as well as hauling significant weight that the ""Up-tuned"" sports car was never intended to haul.

Long term liability of the turbos: the number is something like half of the F150's now have turbos and it is still the best selling truck in the world (Yes, More F150's were sold than Corolla's). Can we put the ""fear"" of turbos argument to rest now and actually focus on the facts? It's been seven years and I would dare say a billion or two combined miles. No one goes on and on with fear of turbos going out in the eco-diesel. The Eco-boost was designed from the ground up with metallurgical content and strength points similar to diesel blocks. These weren't just old gas block that had turbos strapped on. I love how nay sayers will talk about ""You can't put 'all that pressure' on an engine and expect it to last"". Most of these people don't have a clue how much pressure( 15 PSI) is being put on the engine or whether that has any measurable effect on wear. Then you have the ""No replacement for displacement (NRFD), if GM put a turbo on the 6.2; it would smoke the Eco-boost"". This just shows that this crowd of ""NRFD"" has no clue what a turbo does. A turbo artificially makes the engine bigger. Sea level atmospheric PSI is 14.7. At 15 PSI you are effectively doubling (yes this is quick and dirty math, unless someone else wants to write out Boyles law) the natural atmosphere going into the engine 3.5 liter becomes 7 liter. So of course if you put a turbo on a 6.2; it becomes bigger. Stop the presumptions and look at the facts. Full disclosure: I own a 2011 F150 SCREW with the 5.0 (302), would love to get into the eco-boost.",NEGATIVE,0.9975091218948364,lhofYreDu-E,269,2018-04-05 14:30:51+00:00

I have a friend with a 2.5L 187HP nissan rogue (midsize suv) that averages 30mpg in mostly city traffic.  If they did the same driving in a ford taurus they would be getting roughly the same mpg, or worse.

Even if gas prices go up, there won't be much difference between the cars and SUVs now with these newer engines.

The clutch and overall shifting experience is trash, the car is super lean down low and rich anywhere else so it leaves soot all over the back bumper.

Second, I love racing, and have been a big Nascar fan in the past and Ive watched F1 every race every year since around 2003. Ive raced karts in the past, and ive met plenty of people that do grass roots racing, or did it. Its insanely expensive, and in reality its one of the worst sports in the world. If you think golf is expensive and takes a lot of time to be good at (which is does) you haven't seen anything compared to racing. Racing karts is the only reasonable way to race, and that still is very expensive and can be even more expensive with less experienced racers crashing each other and costing you extra cash every weekend. I turned to sim racing, which may be the best way to get that racing experience, although it just feels cheap as well since there is no seat of the pants feel (where's the 0.001% talking about their motion rigs...) and a bunch of kids or people who don't generally care if they ruin your 3 nights of hard work preparing for your weekly iracing race and wreck you on lap 1...It sucks that racing is that way, but its just the way it is. Nascar is feeling it now with all their personalities gone, and F1 is constantly struggling because of the insane budgets teams blow every year. On top of that, because its so expensive, the true ""sport"" or racing is somewhat lost in bigger series because you get pay drivers here, or drivers who should be there not able to make it cuz they don't bring in $$.

The interior is cheap, ugly and busy, the Sync - no matter Sync 2 or Sync 3 - is crap, on Fiesta it looks like a small CRT TV bolted to your dashboard, you cannot get the ST without Sync and without auto climate (thanks that you can get it without super-narrow Recaros), atrocious blinker/washer stalks, the hvac controls have no logic whatsoever, the turning circle is like on an 18-wheeler (but it has two turns lock to lock, yay!), the torque steer is unbelievable in turns, the CD player skips in hard turns, Bluetooth loses connection and there is no 3.5mm input (wtf?), Sync cannot be restarted without turning the engine off, there are no top handles for passengers (this is a hot hatch for crying out loud!), the engine sleeps in comatose until you rev it up to 2500, then you have to shift quickly because the gears are short, the shifter is wobbly, the synchros cannot withstand quick shifts, the brakes would be perfect if they did not bite hard at the very end... All in all, it is a cheap car with 200-hp engine and stiff suspension. Yes, it shows a gentle tendency to oversteer when you lift the right foot, but this is the only delight of this car.

It's so much fun to get on the throttle and whip this thing around. I've been getting some good feedback from passengers as well. My only gripes are 1. Everything has a TORX bolt or weird socket size  2. Backseat is very small but I knew that coming into it and accepted it (also this annoying cup holder in the middle of the back seat foot area) 3. Recaro seats are incredible but only for someone with a healthy BMI *I have a driver's seat Recaro but a base passenger* 4. Trunk is super tiny as well but if you take out the spare tire and hatch privacy thing you can fit a few suitcases standing up *I put a tire repair kit in place of the tire* 5. AndroidAuto is incredible compared to most OEM options and still pretty good compared to a full fledged Android head unit. Sometimes I have to reconnect it but I think that's an issue on my phone's part. 6. BRAKES ARE INSANE BOOSTED. I can't heel-toe this car because I end up going through the windshield!

I chose the 265's M+S rated tires on all corners and experienced first snow in Missouri just recently. With a trunk full of wood and full tank of gas, I made it to work with about an inch on the roads. Any more and will need some Blizzaks (which were absolutely fantastic on 16 Camaro SS). The Mustang averaged 29.7mpg highway at 65mph with 3.55 rear end. Dyno results were 434whp/397ft*lb. My biggest complaint is the new twin disc clutch that locks out gears after it gets too warm. By warm, I mean spending an entire Saturday from dawn till dusk driving twisty roads with friends. If you're worried about getting too ""squirrelly"", rest assured that the new traction management is a very strict nanny. In track mode, you are allowed to slide about 10-15 degrees before it brings you back in. The traction control also kicks in if you are not doing a burnout. You can hold the traction control toggle to disable the nanny by 90%, but it still kicks in with extreme scenarios (1 donut revolution usually triggers power cut). My only gripe is the lack of shifting within legal speeds... The gears are so tall, that 1st alone can hit about 50, 2nd goes to around 80, and 3rd tops out at the end of the quarter mile at 115. If you prefer to bang a lot of gears, Miata with 1:1 6th gear is a much better solution.",NEGATIVE,0.9858301281929016,Yjq4tBYt5Fk,302,2018-11-22 17:07:32+00:00

I drove the 3.3 TT (slight turbo lag) for an entire weekend in Vancouver, Canada just 30 days ago and totally luved it except for: (a) the rear seats are small (b) The resale value & reliability concerns are HUGE (c) I found a huge vibration when cornering - could be the brake vectoring.
BUT - The price point, the maintenance included, the valet service that I received was top notch, that engine was put thru its paces and handled it very well, huge amounts of torque (I enjoy to drive spiritedly when safe to do so- Very very happy with that engine & transmission), many Drive Modes, great sound system and all the safety features.
I used that right pedal and my mileage took a big hit. I also drove on eco mode on a highway trip for 100 kms and got 12.6/100 kms.
The comparable cars will set you back $15K for similar features and options.
I like the looks. My tester had the Blue ext with Red Brembos, dark wheels along with the black & red int. That quilted interior is gorgeous.
Really it has every feature that you want AND the drive, sportiness, turning radius, that ENGINE...WOW!!!

3825,xu6SAy8Jsr4,2020-11-16 18:21:12+00:00,"I am a diehard Ford guy, but I couldn't buy this Explorer. I grew up in Fords, and other than my first car (a Chevette - it was either that or a Pinto!), all of my vehicles have been Fords. We currently have an Edge, and love it, but sometimes it is just a little bit too small, so we wanted something a little bigger. I really, really, really wanted to get the Explorer, but I just couldn't justify it. We ended up getting a Palisade instead. The Palisade has a better safety rating, longer warranty, as good or better reviews, and it costs a lot less than a similarly equipped Explorer. The final straw was hearing about all of the build quality problems in Chicago. 

The only problem with the Palisade so far is ""Hyundai ergonomics"" vs my life time of using ""Ford ergonomics"". For instance, in my Edge, the cruise control is on the left side of the steering wheel, radio on the right, while they are reversed on the Palisade. So I sometimes accidentally change the radio station instead of adjusting the cruise or vice versa. The Palisade is completely push button - emergency brake, transmission, etc. - while the Edge has a emergency brake pedal and a gear shift lever. So, I sometimes find myself in the Palisade trying to push down a non-existent emergency brake pedal or reaching for a non-existent shift lever, rather than pushing the appropriate button. Other buttons, I have to push and hold or push twice instead of just pushing once, and the buttons are in different locations in the two vehicles. I'm getting there, but it has been an adjustment.

Years later they all get taken away and once again an American company is giving Europe it's best cars, meanwhile we get stuck with these consolation prizes.

But then even the fun, quirky crossovers, like the Juke get rejected, and we are just left with these big, ugly, unstyled boxes. That's it, because that's what the American people have said they want. They want their boxy Tahoes and Explorers because they're boring. Ford is like, fine, we'll slap an ST badge on there and maybe that will increase sales and appease all the car enthusiasts we just screwed over, but it feels more like a slap in the face.

Please include a Camaro SS 1LE manual in next years GT500 group track test. While it is not a direct comparison to the GT500 I'm going to go out on a limb and say that it will be a great deal of fun on the track and a worthy car to comparison test with especially when you factor in that it is roughly half the price of a GT500 with the Carbon Fibre Track Pack. My guess is that on the same tire (Pilot Sport Cup 2) the SS 1LE will go toe to toe with the 350R and give the GT500 a run for its money.

They put an unusable buffer at the top and bottom of these batteries to provide protection. Now I do think it's a bad idea to leave the car sitting at 100% charge. However if you're going to be on a road trip and you have to charge to 100% to get to the next station there's no issue doing so.
But you're wasting time at a charger if it's unnecessary the best way to road trip in any EV is to charge up enough to get to the next stop and arrive with 5% or 10% charge left.
Out of spec motoring has lots of great videos showing the most efficient way to road trip in a variety of different electric vehicles.
Totally agree with his rant about the way they charge at stations for the electricity. But the rent really should be against government not Electrify America or whoever the station is run by. Whether it is charged by the kilowatt hour delivered or by the minute is a regulatory issue decided by local government not the people who built the charger they don't have a choice.",NEGATIVE,0.9975885152816772,SpUy8RpRlhM,431,2021-05-08 12:30:01+00:00
5891,SpUy8RpRlhM,2021-05-07 22:18:31+00:00,"11:59 I think it's expectations - we have a set of expectations with gas cars that we go to the gas station and fill them to 100% and get 100% of the range (MPG / Tank Capacity), less that little bit that is at the bottom of the tank after the ""gas light"" comes on. 
Compounded by the fact that manufacturers quote the 100% drained battery as the full mileage of the car (i.e. 258 miles for the Bolt) when NEITHER ONE of those assumptions is correct! 
1. Nobody is going to drain their electric car to zero (except you guys and your Ioniq, amirite?) because AAA can't just bring you a gallon of gas to get you to the gas station. But much like gas cars, people WILL drive past the ""gas light"" (which in my old Promaster came on with over 100 miles left in the tank!) until they get nervous - say, 10-20 miles left.
2. EVs are different, so why do we try to treat them the same? Why do we have an expectation that they'll be ""fuill"" when we leave the ""gas"" station, when the batteries are most efficient from 80% anyway?

I think the optimum solution is to be charged a per minute rate based on the capability of the fast charger (i.e. 1000 kw charger is $1/minute and the 500kw charger is $0.50/min), with the expectation that you'll charge to 80% and drive away like that's THE SAME THING AS A FULL TANK IN A GAS CAR...

The reality is that driving a gas car isn't THAT much different! 
258 mile range in a gas car, and the gas light will come on at about 219 miles driven and you're gonna look for fuel. 
258 mile range in an EV, and you charge to 80%, you have 206 mile range and will start looking for a ""gas station"" at probably 195 miles.

All this fuss, and the difference in actual daily experience is really only 25 miles, or 1/2 a day's commute drive - EXCEPT that Garage People (not ""garbage people"", sheesh) can plug in to the wall at night and get 60 miles per day at their Hydro rate, which you definitely can't do in a gas car...

6164,SpUy8RpRlhM,2021-05-07 14:13:55+00:00,"Ok guys, as a Model 3 Performance owner I have a few remarks.  First, Tesla does NOT tell it's owners to never charge to 100%.  What they say is to reserve charging to 100% for road trips.  Charging to 100% and leaving it there is what is bad for the battery.  And no, it does NOT take forever to charge a Model 3 to 100% at a Supercharger.

Next, handling.  I also own a '07 Boxster S, and from my perspective the two things that separate the Boxster from the Model 3 is body control and overall grip.  The Model 3 is set up as a daily driver that handles well (prioritizing comfort), while the Boxster is set up as a sports car that can be daily driven.  In fact, I was SHOCKED at how well the Model 3 handles once I got used to it. It has double wishbone suspension up front, and multi-link in the rear!  The Model 3 has more body roll, and therefore isn't as agile as the Boxster.   If the Model 3 had spring and damping rates that prioritized performance over ride, it would match the Boxster's handling.  In  my opinion.  With respect to overall grip, the Model 3 will never match the Boxster because it weighs 1200 pounds more while riding on less rubber.

The only thing ""Beta""  about the Model 3 is FSD, and Summon.  Everything else about the software is as polished as polished gets.  The over the air updates are akin to the software updates your computer gets.  Except that with Tesla, they also provide new features on a pretty regular basis.  Oh, and mine has no build quality issues.

Finally IMHO, with the Mach E, Ford has come closer to matching Tesla than any other manufacturer when it comes to offering a vehicle that just works for the consumer,  Including the Taycan  (too expensive), the E-tron (too expensive and it just sucks for range) to name a couple.

Also no width is not good when going off road so that‚Äôs bad on the bronco side. My h3 alpha felt wider but not like the H2. Ask H1 owners width is not a good thing. I can agree to the spacious cabin but that‚Äôs not what you want off road. 

Road manners isn‚Äôt really something I cared for in the H3 and H2 (both with independent front suspension and the H2 drove better cause 1 ton class truck and air suspension <which I replaced with coils after the compressor failed> but ya those arguments don‚Äôt hold for a review guys sorry to call you out on it.

And please tell me Carson isn't an unpaid intern just ""happy to be there.""  
ONE thing on the steering: the thinking behind independent front suspension (best augmented by the sway-bar disconnect) is that it can incorporate a more modern steering, rack and pinion. A Jeep using the reciprocating thing that's not really as precise especially on the highway, which virtually HAS to be traveled on to get to the tough stuff. Now, well-trod off-roaders are quite familiar with Wrangler steering and don't even mention a difference, but  you two did, and KUDOS for that. It would be good to note that the sway-bar disconnect can be done on the rock in the Bronco, unlike the Wrangler. And I think the camera system is superior on the Bronco especially for trails, but otherwise tech at this trim is pretty much a dead heat. 
THAT said, of course the width of the Bronco is an issue for the hard-core segment since some trails are rather narrow. Not so much as to stop the Bronco but risk more scrapes in the paint, presumably. And missing the V-8 torque is a thang too. Still, I'm certain Ford will challenge that in the next edition. 
But really? Comparing a Defender? Great, if it gets you to the top AND down, more than once. But dependability is still something Rover needs to prove they've answered before I even consider one.

I knew a guy who had one and it is scary in the highway, just to change lanes there's body roll.   My question is the Bronco a Naturally Aspirated V6, because is the only way I would buy it?   In the past had trouble with Turbo locking up and suffocating intake dropping horsepower to less than half, and mpg went from 32 mpg to 8 mpg.  The reason Manufactures Mount the turbo low for lower center of gravity, and reduce weight with shorter down pipe.  The problem is that they mount it too close to the engine Down Pipe is connected to the exhaust, and backflow shoots carbon build up, locking impellers. having to remove and clean every 2 to 3 years, then the 5 year Turbo heats up causing heating of the engine and the cylinder it's next to. There is thermal heating and the cylinder wall expands with thermal expansion, causing the Piston Rings (blades) cutting more of the bore wall.  Then when engine cools, on cold starts the check engine turns on for low compression on the cylinder it's mounted too. Engine shakes violently due to low compression the shaking wears off the engine and transmission mounts. You ask why low compression on cold start. Well had mentioned Thermal Expansion, when cooling there's the Opposite Thermal Contraction so on cold start there's is a floating piston moving even more thus loose compression.. It's like Tuners who mount the Turbos away from the engine up high to the Heat Extraction Vents...

As a farmer, a mountain biker, and father of three little ones I see this as a great option for a replacement commuter car that is highly functional. I think it falls down a bit in regards to value as you price it up in the higher trims but as a base or XL trim, specifically in the hybrid, you have a super flexible, efficient vehicle that can get in the 40mpg range for my wife‚Äôs 45 minute one way daily commute yet still bring home a load of feed from the feed store, OR haul kids around. It‚Äôs refreshing to me as a guy who likes more utilitarian vehicles, Defenders, old Land Cruisers, old pickups... he‚Äôll we have a couple VW Things.... but here we have a perfectly modern, comfortable car, that can haul 5 people, haul gear or supplies, it‚Äôs not fancy, but nice and it‚Äôs efficient and cheap. In the XL or XLT trim you are looking at 21k to maybe 25k nicely specced. That‚Äôs a damn renaissance and I think the reason why so many people are stoked about this thing. Not the higher trims, give me a base XL with steel rims, a set of snow tires for our northern Michigan winters and you have the winner of the useful versus cost contest. Love it. Yeah maybe the awd turbo setup is faster and probably more fun, maybe as a sport truck or something but for most people the hybrid is going to be pretty compelling... especially as we see the world transitioning over towards electric cars and with the uncertainty of gas prices going forward... a hybrid is a pretty safe bet on operating costs and I would guess resale as well 5-10 years from now.

EDIT: As a European, I think many of the problems you guys described go unnoticed here. The old Ranger was the perfect-sized truck for many business doing light hauling work, as well as for government agencies like the forestry service or border patrols, where an SUV was expensive to use. And I think it'll stay that way for a while too, explaining also why Ford or Toyota have kept the old platforms.
It's a similar scenario to the Crown Vic being used well-beyond its intended life-span simply because it was a very good tool for a very specific set of jobs.
The Maverick is too nice on the interior for fleets to buy and lacks the sturdiness of the Ranger, while the Bronco, albeit an excellent niche off-roader for enthusiasts, will not attract fleet buyers either since it's more expensive.
The final factor is the F-150. It'll technically do everything a Ranger does, but better: it tows more, hauls more, has durable power-trains that are highly customizable, etc. But the reality is, it only works in very few places in the world outside of the US. The Aussies are probably the other good market for it, but the infrastructure in many countries simply doesn't deal well with their width and weight. They, ironically, offer too much, no one needs to carry or tow as much as they can 80% of the time, so ownership is restricted to folks who have a thing for Americana or specific businesses who do some heavy-duty work.
For everyone else though, the Ranger is the perfect size. You even pointed out during the driving segment, Americans see the Ranger as a mid-size truck, but here it's pretty much full-size, with anything larger being just excessive (I'm not even gonna get into the likes of the Chevy Kodiak of the Ford F 600 and 700 series, which are unfathomable to most people here).",NEGATIVE,0.9918295741081238,NLy_GgcBT_0,458,2021-11-16 13:00:09+00:00

9513,NLy_GgcBT_0,2021-11-15 12:52:18+00:00,"I feel like the twin turbo 2.0L diesel in the global market is actually the better engine for that 10-speed gearbox. In my personal experience owning a Ranger Raptor, that extra 59 lbft. (369lbft.) of torque at 1500rpm just makes shifting at high speed so much smoother compared to the 2.3 in the video. 

I assume that unlike the 2.3, the diesel actually needs the shorter ratios to keep it in the torque band. In combination with the high torque at low RPM, it doesn't shudder and vibrate like the 2.3. 

I think Ford just put the gasoline engine there because gasoline is cheaper than diesel in the US.

Ford even gave the 10 speed a software update so that it doesn't hold 1st gear at 2500rpm for too long. It just feels like the right gearbox for the diesel. Maybe the last 2 overdrive gears are unnecessary, but it actually feels great still being in peak torque while cruising at 130-140kph in 10th gear (80-88mph).  The Raptor has a 106mph top speed so it's not like I'll get much more anyway. 

The USDM T6 Ranger just feels like an afterthought. It's disappointing because the global Ranger with the EcoBlue diesel actually performs exponentially better than its rivals. 

I can say this with confidence because I work in construction and we all use and compare our local midsize pickup trucks and all the other contractors agree.

The other disappointing thing is that they even thought about bringing the T6 Ranger to the US in the first place. It's too large for what Americans remember it as, and is in a size segment that no American would truly capitalize. 

The Maverick is a way better truck for the USDM than the Ranger for the small business owner, and the F150 is already the best selling full size truck. I don't even have faith in the 2023 model because the spy shots look like the chassis is still based on the T6.",NEGATIVE,0.992620050907135,NLy_GgcBT_0,458,2021-11-16 13:00:09+00:00

The 6.2's are hogs and rarely get close to 20 on the highway from my experience (of course these are mostly F-250-450's) and I just don't care for them very much.   But driven as most people drive them....when you're pulling around 4000+lbs of truck...they all do about the same, so the excessive gearing trying to milk a couple more mpg's on the high speed highway....mostly just irritates as they're grunting below 1500 rpm.

Don't get me wrong, customizable is good; but when everything is an option, why even bother with the any of the ""packages"" that already add thousands of dollars to the price?
With the new Maverick, ALL of the trim levels feature a relatively cheap interior, so they offer a so-called ""Luxury"" package, which does nothing more than bring the interior content up to the level you'll get in most base models from Japan and Korea. 
In this respect, I'm more inclined to get the top of the line small trucks that Honda and Hyundai offer because those actually come fully loaded, with very few exceptions.
Honda, Hyundai Mazda, Subaru and Genesis have the right idea, because their top trim levels come with just about everything they have to offer, so you don't feel as though you left thousands of dollars worth of additional goodies out of the build when you buy one.",NEGATIVE,0.9939926266670227,NLy_GgcBT_0,458,2021-11-16 13:00:09+00:00

The Raptor is a better tuned chassis overall. The TRX may be the current straight line king but even then Fords only a year or so away from letting the Raptor R loose which in theory should have the excellent chassis and suspension tuning that went into the regular Raptor, but with a burly 760hp+ supercharged 5.2L Predator V8 to keep it toe to toe with the TRX in the straight line game, in fact I have little doubt that the Raptor R will outrun the TRX simply because the TRX is massively overweight, in most cases 700 to 1000lbs more than a comparable Raptor, so as long as the Raptor R doesn't somehow gain 500lbs or more I suspect it'll make short work of the TRX in not only drag races but overall performance.",NEGATIVE,0.9965002536773682,m36IloDM_R0,470,2022-02-06 13:41:56+00:00

Over the top, impractical, but just stupid amounts of fun. If ram was serious with the trx, it would of started with a 392 srt engine for a base engine (or even the 395 hp 5.7) and they would of had more tiers of TRX. But the TRX is still based on the ram 1500, heavily, and has all the same issues as the regular 1500, including being the heaviest half ton, the engines being very old in design, and all the wrong focus. 

The raptor just takes everything ford has done right with the f150 and just runs with it. (except the exhaust I'll get to that) The truck is lighter overall, the powerplant makes more sense, the smaller engine means less cooling which means even less weight. Just so many things in the raptor make more sense than they do in the TRX. I am curious how the ZR2 silverado compares if it's ever released, which should hopefully happen in a few months. 

Side note, engine note coming out of this thing is just... wrong.

FORD IS LISTENING TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. Stubbornly, but they are listening.

Think about the F-150's Today Now (Yes, I am aware of the 'shortages', but still):
You have SO MANY OPTIONS and Trims that you can practically Customize the F-150 to be what you want it to be.
Want a Base XL with a V6 that's Both Efficient and Economical? You can Purchase One.
Want an STX with an 2.7 Ecoboost or V8 Engine that gives you the BEST Value for an F-150? Absolutely!
Want a Lariat some Comfort Features that won't Blow your Wallet Completely Sky High? It's there.
Want a Limited with all the Possible Options at your Disposal? You sure can.
And Now... You want a Supercharged V8 that will FINALLY put to rest the Ecoboost V6 and make the TRX potentially piss in it's pants? It's FINALLY Here!

This is the reason the F-150 Sells so well: There are so many ways to customize the F-150 that Fits both your lifestyle and / or your Needs.
I'm finally glad to the Raptor R, but I do expect this to be a 'Limited Edition F-150' that will be inflated to shit in price...
But I'm thankful is here... The TRX Needed Competition, anyway.

Plug-in electric adoption rates will track the power generation capacity industry where enough grid capacity is added each year to match the demand (as a whole). There will be instances where some areas grow grid faster than adoption and areas where the grid grows slower than adoption. Home-based solar systems with battery backup can supplant the demand for many folks in many regions at a cost...but early adopters tend to be higher income who can adapt their homes before industry finds the right push-pull balance.",NEGATIVE,0.9830964803695679,a7RWJu7RNWU,493,2022-07-19 10:00:03+00:00

One thing I can mention is that the Lightning with the Max Tow package has a second AC compressor with its own AC refrigerant loop dedicated to cooling/chill the motor electronics coolant to prevent overheating of the powertrain under load. It has an AC condensor with a split design: the top half dedicated to the high voltage battery and the bottom half dedicated to the motor electronics and cabin AC. So the Max Tow Lightnings still have only one AC condensor, but it performs the job of two and serves two completely separate AC compressors. The standard Lightning has the one condensor serving one compressor. Either way: for packaging purposes the radiator, fan and consensor are underneath the frunk/front bumper angled down, since the Lightning doesn't really have a front grille anymore.


As far as coolant goes the Lightning has a motor electronics cooling system with three coolant loops, one for the high voltage battery, one for the electric powertrain/motor electronics and one for the cabin. They are all connected with diverter valves and all three coolant loops share the same degas bottle. This is different from the Mach-E and E-Transit, which also has three loops but 2 degas bottles: one for the high voltage battery and one for  the motor electronics/cabin HVAC. In the Lightning, Mach-E and E-Transit the cabin coolant loop branches off of the motor electronics loop, so it's really more like 2.5 loops, but again, they all are connected with diverter valves anyway.

Either way, the idea is that the AC refrigerant can cool the coolant using a ""chiller"" if the coolant gets too hot. It's not really new technology, the first generation Escape hybrid had a coolant chiller in 2005.


Can't speak too much on anything else, this is just coming from the service manual and new model training they give us technicians. Respect to other technicians though, the amount of knowledge we have to learn to do our job well is really starting to approach engineer-levels of knowledge.

-Get a crewcab/4X4 18-20 F150 with a Coyote. 
-Add one of these intake manifolds: ported Boss 302, 18+ Mustang GT, GT350/Bullitt/Mach1, or Cobra Jet manifold. 
-Get it custom flex fuel tuned by a reputable tuner like AMRL, OZ, Lund, etc.
-Reliably spin the engine to 7,500-7,800 RPM like a Mustang, run E85, and go run high 12's. 

If you want to RCSB/2WD and sticky tire it, you'll be running low 12's with the potential of breaking into the high 11's. 

To recap that's high 12's with just a port Mustang intake manifold, a tune, and E85 in a 4WD, crewcab F150 with a GEN3 Coyote and a 10R80. The Ecoboost guys can spell out for you how to easily run 12's or 11's as well. You want to easily hit 10's then invest in a Whipple manifold instead of a ported Mustang manifold.

BTW my 18 5L F150 with a 36 gallon tank has right under a 500 mile range on E85 and I think about a 620-640 range on gasoline, but I haven't run gasoline in it in a while so I can't remember, but it was easily over 600 miles of driving on a tank if you're driving normal, and not beating on it hard.",NEGATIVE,0.9971362352371216,a7RWJu7RNWU,493,2022-07-19 10:00:03+00:00

Plenty of Horsepower & Torque, and they didn't change the Interior of the F-150 TOO Much. It's the Same F-150 we all KNOW & LOVE, Just with an Electric Motor WITH 4X4 STANDARD! (No FX4 Package of Any Kind, Unfortunately.)

The BIGGEST Downside of this Vehicle (And One that I think will KEEP this Truck from selling well) is the Battery Range. You're looking at 250 Miles on the Standard Range Battery and 450 Miles on the Extended Range Battery. I don't know about you, but having to Pay $20K+ to go about the Same Range as MOST Combustion-Engines is, and should be, a Major Turn-Off for Some. Lithium Batteries are JUST NOT where it needs to be in terms of Efficiency and Range Overall. Add in a Trailer of 5K Lbs. or More, and Your Range Drops to 100-200 Miles at MOST!

As a Result, I see the F-150 Lightning, in its current state, as more of a 'Status Symbol' kind of Truck. It's not Practical for the things most people will use their Trucks for (Towing, Payload Hauling, Work Truck Use, etc.), and Overall, Is just TOO MUCH Money for a Truck that Doesn't do Enough due to its Limited Range.

HOWEVER... This STILL is, from my perspective, THE MOST PRACTICAL ELECTRICAL VEHICLE ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW. If you want a Electrified Vehicle that can do practically anything... THIS IS IT. Ford has hit a HOME RUN with their F-150 Lightning, but further Technological Advancements in Battery Power WILL Need to Happen to UNLEASH the Lightning's FULL POTENTIAL.

Then to to connect, you'd use basically a 240V extension cord that  feeds in the truck power. For about $150 in parts, you can install the interlock switch kit and just use your main panel. The downside is when the power goes out, you have to go out to the panel, turn all the breakers off, flip the interlock from grid power to generator input power,  then turn back on the circuits you want to use powered by the truck/generator. That also means you have no idea when the regular grid power comes back online since you've switched from grid power to generator.

All I hear is that if you avoid deep charge and discharge, the battery will last for more charge cycles, i.e. prolonging battery life. But it is never explained in detail. Does it refer to theoretical full charge cycles or to the actual narrowed charge cycles?
For example: If, theoretically, using a battery only between 40% and 60% charge gave you 8000 charge cycles and using it between 30% and 70% gave you  only 4000, then it would be the same, since each charge cycle covers twice the usable energy.
Is there a complex curve with identifiable sweet spots? Or is the usual norm of charging to only 80% for longevity just a compromise decision by manufacturers between longevity and practicality?

Do electric cars (all) allow you to choose your own charge limits? If someone is only doing short-distance drives, wouldn't they want to cap charge to 60% to presumably further improve battery longevity? (I imagine, apart from cars, electric toothbrushes and razors would be particularly interesting here, since they almost always just sit in the charger. Also DECT phones or such. But there also seem to be at least NiMH batteries that are optimized for this constant top refresh charge.)

Also interesting here is whether what burdens battery lifespan is more the charge state or the use of it in a certain charge state.

It appears the same thing is happening with the Explorer.  Like the Crown Vic, Ford sells so many Explorers to the law enforcement community that the Chicago Assembly Plant could work 24/7/365 into perpetuity producing nothing but the PIU variant, and the company will continue realizing a healthy profit on the Explorer regardless whether or not they improve the vehicle overall.  (Similar situation with the Dodge Charger _vis-a-vis_ fleet sales, a model and platform that would've been euthanized years ago but for the fact that sales to police departments support its bottom line and allow SRT--with the blessing of Stellantis--to keep offering increasingly more absurd versions of the architecturally identical Challenger to civilian consumers for huge ROI. until strict emissions regulations ultimately kill it off in the next couple years.)  In other words, FoMoCo doesn't really need to sell many Explorers to the general public anymore because fleet sales more than cover their expected profits for the platform, while conversely the company would actually lose money by investing to improve civilian versions of the Explorer.  Accordingly, the company has little incentive to do so.

I find it curious how Ford gave up on the Explorer's off-roady pretenses when they dumped the stick axle in back for an IRS setup with the 3rd-gen/U152 in 2002, recognizing that most buyers preferred a comfortable, predictable ride on pavement where they spent most of their time driving to whatever capability their Explorer might possess when rarely driven off of it, yet now hope the Subaru Outback/Volvo V70XC marketing concept translates to buyers of full-size American SUVs with the Timberline.

I drive the non turbo V6 which doesn't have enough power to pass cars in the upper gears and its fuel economy with normal not police driving struggles to get 14.5 mpg. The V6 is an absolute dog in terms of power and the transmission regularly gets stuck hunting for gears.

The only reason the police use this vehicle is because there are no better options, somehow GM has managed to make the Tahoe PPV even more unreliable than the Explorer.

I'm a 2-time local SCCA Champion, and hold 2-time Fastest Time Of Day's. We're not the fastest in the straight line, but on a very tight, technical autocross course, we can have the edge. We placed 5th out of 77 cars at the Ford Fest Autocross (that's a lot of V8's beat!). 

The S550 is an incredible car no matter what engine is in it.  But I've had GT and Shelby guys ask how I get the car to rotate so well. A lot of it is 200 lbs less on the nose. Despite the hell I've put it through, it's been incredibly reliable. I've worn brakes, tires, bushings, and bearings faster than the average driver. Otherwise, no major issues.

I too don't understand why someone would have purchased my car new. Premium Performance Pack car stickers $37,000 in 2015. Well into GT territory. I scooped it up in 2018, with 18,000 miles, for $18,000. Sitting at 108,000 now, I'm not the least bit worried. Done all the preventative maintenance with only top-quality consumables. Blackstone oil analysis say the engine is looking fantastic.

The key to longevity is to treat ALL CARS with mechanical sympathy. Don't do a cold start and mat the pedal to the floor. Let the car warm up. Don't shut it off hot, let the car run and cool off for a couple minutes. And the biggest thing with these boost engines: DON'T LUG THE ENGINE.

The base gt gets you more power sure but everything else about it is lack lister. And I think the convertible ruins the intent for the HPP. Buttoned down the v6 s550 was razor sharp and the fenders eat 275 wide tires which makes the car handle so well without the weight of the V8 cars. This eco-boom model takes advantage of that and offers a comprehensive package for the track goer without the consumables of the V8. Outside of that mindset. It makes no sense to buy one over a base gt. If all you want is to sound good with your borla atak's and have a v8 sure. The stock v8 is abismal to drive and the brakes are definitely too small for the car. My experiences anyways. Also gt350r > Mach 1 to this day.

Some people just like Turbo-4 cars, many of the people I know who own these grew up with 4 cylinder JDM cars, and now if you wanted to buy a new Turbo-4 RWD JDM car there really isnt anything around anymore from Japan. Ironically the best old school 90s style rwd JDM car thats still on the market now IS the Ecoboost Mustang, and to top it off the 2.3L Ecoboost is basically a upgraded version of the Mazda MZR engine platform which many JDM tuners are already very familiar with.

As for the price, yeah it doesnt make sense to buy these highly specced ones that cost as much or more than a V8, nobody i know who bought a Ecoboost paid more than V8 money for theirs. Either they got a nice spec at a big discount from the dealer, or they bought a base model or 2nd hand car which they used as a base for their upgrades. It for sure helps to have the performance pack option if youre going to build it since youre getting the better diff and brakes for far cheaper than you would if you had to DIY those options.

So yeah, its popular because its a cheap RWD turbo car thats going to have less issues than say a 20+ year old Nissan 240SX.

Yes, the MT-82 Getrag manual transmission blows, but for anyone who bought a HPP 2.3L EcoBoost Mustang and manual transmission on top of that whether in convertible or coupe, I'm not mad at you. You have a Mustang and that's what's important.

Would I get an EcoBoost Mustang 2.3L HPP? Absolutely. In fastback coupe format, why not?  Gas is expensive even though you'll still have to use the highest grade octane in your car, but I'd rather save fuel than constantly refueling off of an 8-cylinder anything vehicle. I'm not a Mustang owner, but I do drive an 8-cylinder sport sedan and the fuel goes super quick.

The TRX makes 113hp per liter. If Ford increased the Supercharged Coyote engine to 6.2 liters, the Raptor would have 830hp. On the other hand, If Dodge decreased the Supercharged  Hemi to 5.2 liters it would make 587hp. These figures are within a few horsepower as the Ram makes 113.xxx horsepower per liter and the Raptor makes  134.xxx horsepower per liter. I didn't figure in the numbers after the decimal. Just like every one of these type videos I watch, someone is quick to talk about the weight disadvantage but you dont hear them mention the cubic inch disadvantage. 400lbs is significant but not as significant as the difference in cubic inches. The TRX is 7 percent heavier than the Raptor but has a 20 percent larger engine displacement. That 20 percent larger engine made TWO more horsepower...lol. As with every single recent engine offering from the big 3, whether it be the naturally aspirated versions of the 5.0 Coyote truck engine (80hp per liter) vs a 5.7 Hemi truck engine (69hp per liter) or the 6.2 Silverado truck engine (67hp per liter) or the Supercharged engines such as these, Ford dominates horsepower per liter and if they add cubic inches to thier extremely efficient engines they completely destroy everything. They do more with less. The same math works in the car engine offerings. The 2022 Mustang GT 5.0 makes 450hp, thats 90hp per liter naturally aspirated. The 2022 Camaro SS 6.2 makes 455hp, thats 73hp per liter naturally aspirated. Why doesn't Chevy put the 5.3 V8 in the SS Camaro? Because it wont compete with the 5.0 Coyote, thats why. If you bump the Coyote liters up to 6.2, thats 558hp. The whimpy base F150 3.3 liter naturally aspirated V6 makes 290hp, thats 87hp per liter. Fords engine designs dominate efficiency...convincingly.

My observations as a trx owner is
The only race that mattered is the street race as thats where 99% of these trucks will be. 

The super charger sound is really disappointing on the raptor r.  

The tire size difference may not be as big a deal. The trx has wider (325) tires compared to the R (315). It would be interesting to see a tire swap race. Haha. 

I‚Äôve been in a raptor v6.  My opinion on the interior is the trx just feel more luxurious.  The raptor has the better camera system and gauge cluster if you like all digital.  The shifter on the raptor has a cheap feel and sound and no heated steering wheel is just not acceptable for us northerners. 

The trx‚Äôs steering wheel is so much more sexier with the feel and the flat bottom.  The head up display is a game changer to at least give your self a chance to avoid a speeding ticket.  

The performance pages on the trx are also a fun perk.  The stereo is also much better in the ram. 

The ford is hands down the better off-road truck as it‚Äôs light on it feet and just has a better feel and control.

They upcharge way too much on these top models. Not like an $85,000 TRX is Affordable. Heck most people can't get any of the three baja trucks. Depending on how a regular Raptor is spec ed, it cost about the same as a TRX. Shame on the bean counters at Ford for not making it at least faster than the TRX if they want 110 grand for it.
